## Cheese Counter
Multi-threaded java program that models a cheese store. There are two types of customers, bold and meek. 
Bold customers shove to the front of the line in order to be served first.
To enforce fairness, the system is modeled with a synchronized get ticket action that ensure customers are served in order.
Each customer runs on a seperate thread.

## How to Run
1. Install java
2. Compile and run
```
javac CheeseCounter.java
java CheeseCounter
```
